1. **Import Required Libraries and Functions**  
   Import essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, train_test_split, LogisticRegression, and accuracy_score.

2. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**  
   - Load the dataset from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.  
   - Generate statistical summaries of the data.  
   - Retrieve the number of rows and columns in the dataset.  
   - Count the occurrences of each class label.  
   - Use the `groupby` function to calculate the mean value of the labels.

3. **Separate Labels and Features**  
   Divide the dataset into feature variables and the target label.

4. **Split Data into Training and Testing Sets**  
   Partition the data into training and testing sets, specifying the proportion for the test size.

5. **Train the Logistic Regression Model**  
   Train the logistic regression model using the `LogisticRegression` function on the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Calculate and display the accuracy of the model on the training data.  
   - Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the testing data and report the accuracy.

7. **Create a Predictive System**  
   Build a predictive system to make predictions based on new input data.

8. **Prepare Input for Prediction**  
   Accept input data, reshape it into a numpy array, and prepare it for making predictions.

9. **Return Predicted Values**  
   Output the predicted class label for the input instance.
